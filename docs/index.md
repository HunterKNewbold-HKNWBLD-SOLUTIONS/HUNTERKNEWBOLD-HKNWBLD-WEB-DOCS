# HKNWBLD Internal Documentation

This site is an operating system for delivery.

It exists to:
- document what we do,
- make work repeatable,
- reduce cost leakage from improvisation,
- leave systems operable without dependency.

## Operating rule

**Diagnosis precedes tools.**  
If the system is not documented, changes are guesswork.

## What never belongs here

- credentials, tokens, recovery codes
- client PII (names tied to private issues, phone/email, invoices)
- anything that would create harm if copied outside this repository

## Where to start

- **Start Here → Overview**
- **Delivery Playbooks → Phase 0 — Diagnostic**
- **Standards → Documentation Standard**

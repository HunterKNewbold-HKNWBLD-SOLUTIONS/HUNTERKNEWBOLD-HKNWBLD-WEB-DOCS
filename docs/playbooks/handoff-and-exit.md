# Handoff & Exit

## Objective

Leave the client with documented systems they can operate without dependency.

## Procedure (high level)

2. Transfer ownership using the approved secure channel (do not store secrets here).
3. Deliver documentation pack (inventory, map, runbooks, failure modes).
4. Walkthrough and verify the client can perform the top recurring actions.
5. Confirm exit conditions and boundaries.

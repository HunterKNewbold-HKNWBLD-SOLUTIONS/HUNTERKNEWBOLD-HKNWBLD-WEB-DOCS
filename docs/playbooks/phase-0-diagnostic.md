# Phase 0 — Diagnostic

## Objective

Replace assumptions with a documented system map.

## Scope

- inventory tools, accounts, and ownership
- trace input → transformation → output for customer flow
- identify failure modes and cost leakage
- produce a bounded plan for Phase 1

## Procedure

1. Collect access and ownership facts (domain, GBP, hosting, analytics, CRM).
2. Map data flow: where customer info enters, where it is stored, where it is lost.
3. Identify the top three failure modes (by cost and disruption).
4. Define constraints (budget, staffing, tolerance for change).
5. Produce deliverables.

## Deliverables

- system inventory (who owns what)
- system map (flow + breakpoints)
- prioritized plan with exclusions
- recommended next step: stabilize or stop

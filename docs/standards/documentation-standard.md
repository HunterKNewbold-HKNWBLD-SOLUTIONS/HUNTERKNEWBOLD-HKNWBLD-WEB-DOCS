# Documentation Standard

Every SOP or playbook must include:

## Required sections

1. **Objective**
2. **Scope / Out-of-scope**
3. **Inputs** (accounts, assets, access required)
4. **Procedure** (step-by-step)
5. **Validation checks**
6. **Failure modes** (what breaks, how you detect it)
7. **Rollback**
8. **Ownership / Handoff artifacts**

## Enforcement rule

If a sentence does not increase clarity, reduce ambiguity, or build justified trust, remove it.

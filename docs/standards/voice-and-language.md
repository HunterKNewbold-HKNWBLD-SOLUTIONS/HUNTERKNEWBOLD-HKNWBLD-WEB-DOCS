# Voice & Language

## Voice pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **Diagnostic-first**  
State the system reality before naming a solution.

2. **Plain-English precision**  
Short sentences. Concrete nouns and verbs. Minimal adjectives.

3. **Practitioner authority**  
Write like an operator. No speculative claims.

4. **Restraint**  
No trend language. No urgency theatrics. Durable wording.

## Sales posture (when relevant)

We do not sell solutions. We validate problems.

If the problem is unclear, the next step is diagnostic—not implementation.

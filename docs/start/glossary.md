# Glossary

**Audit-grade**  
Documentation that allows a third party to verify what exists, what changed, and why.

**Control recovery**  
Regaining verified ownership of a business-critical asset (domain, GBP, hosting, analytics, payment tools).

**Cost leakage**  
Ongoing cost created by redundancy, rework, poor handoffs, or unstable tooling.

**Diagnostic**  
A bounded engagement that produces a system inventory, system map, and a prioritized stabilization plan.

**Failure mode**  
A specific way a system breaks, including how it is detected and the cost of failure.

**Handoff artifact**  
The deliverables that allow the client to operate without dependency (credentials ownership, documentation, runbooks, and exit conditions).

**Input → transformation → output**  
The default model for describing systems. If it cannot be traced end-to-end, it cannot be trusted.

**Stabilization**  
Reducing fragility by fixing ownership, removing ambiguity, and establishing baselines before adding new tooling.

**Tool-first**  
Starting with software selection or automation before the system is documented. Noncompliant by default.

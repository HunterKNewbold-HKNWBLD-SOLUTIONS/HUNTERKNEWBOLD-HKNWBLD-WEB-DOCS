# Overview

This documentation is written for operators.

It is not marketing copy. It is not a knowledge dump. It is a set of constraints and runbooks.

## How we work

1. **Diagnose**: map the system and find failure modes.
2. **Design**: propose the minimum architecture required.
3. **Implement**: ship changes with rollback paths and ownership transfer.

## Definition: “internal”

Internal means **not client-facing**. It does not mean private by default.

Write as if the material could be read by a skeptical third party. If it would be harmful, it does not belong here.

## Source of truth
